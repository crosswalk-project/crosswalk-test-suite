  <p>
    <strong>Test that 32-bit Crosswalk app with embedded mode for ARM can dynamic switch
            to load shared library instead of its embedded library in 64-bit IA device with
            no installed Crosswalk runtime library.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Test steps:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Build "demo" app with 32-bit Crosswalk library:<br/>
        $ crosswalk-pkg --crosswalk=[crosswalk-version] --platform=android --android=embedded --targets=arm /path/to/testapps/demo</li>
    <li>Install the built "demo" to 64-bit IA device(No crosswalk runtime library installed), and launch it.</li>
    <li>Uninstall the installed app</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Expected Output:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The apk named like "demo" is built successfully.</li>
    <li>The app named like "Demo V0.1" is installed and launched successfully.</li>
    <li>The app is uninstalled successfully.</li>
  </ol>
