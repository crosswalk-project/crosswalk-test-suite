  <h4>Pre-condition: </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>GMS (Google Mobile Services)</br>

    <li>Google account</br>
    Make sure Google Play has been installed in the Android system. Make sure you can access Google Play.

    </li>
    <li>Sign the iapdemo.apk use iapdemo.keystore before the test.<br />
    This test requires the apk running as release mode, so you must sign it before test. Please use the iapdemo.keystore as the key to sign the apk.

    <li>No GFW</br>
