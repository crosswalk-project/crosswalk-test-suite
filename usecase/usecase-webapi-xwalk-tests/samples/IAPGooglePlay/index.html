  <h4>Pre-condition: </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>GMS (Google Mobile Services)</br>
    IAP is provided by GMS, which means the device must have Google Play and Google Wallet installed.</br>
    For Nexus 5 device, which is shipped Android 4.4 KitKat, they have been integrated in the system.
    <li>Google account</br>
    Make sure Google Play has been installed in the Android system. Make sure you can access Google Play.
    A Google account with an available Google Wallet which should been granted as a tester of the test app org.xwalk.iapdemo from Google Play.
    </li>
    <li>Sign the iapdemo.apk use iapdemo.keystore before the test.<br />
    This test requires the apk running as release mode, so you must sign it before test. Please use the iapdemo.keystore as the key to sign the apk.
    </li>
    <li>No GFW</br>
    IAP is not provided in China mainland, we must find a way to go over GFW to test IAP functionalities. (Maybe in the future, Google Play returns China mainland, then we can test this case without the aid of VPN!)
