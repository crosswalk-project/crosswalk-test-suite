      <h2>Preconditions:</h2>
      <p>Debian testing is the only tested platform. Node.js, the debuild tool, the Crosswalk runtime, and git must be functional</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download Crosswalk app tools: git clone https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-app-tools.git</li>
        <li>Checkout the iOS backend: cd node_modules, then git clone https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-app-tools-deb.git crosswalk-app-tools-backend-deb</li>
        <li>Install dependencies: cd crosswalk-app-tools-backend-deb, then npm install, and cd ../..</li>
        <li>The main script is crosswalk-app-tools/bin/crosswalk-app. Set environment PATH or invoke with directory</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Test Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Execute command "crosswalk-app create com.example.packingtool"</li>
        <li>Copy web application resources from "res/testapp/org.packagemanage.packingtool"to "com.example.packingtool/app", enter directory "com.example.packingtool", then execute command "crosswalk-app build"</li>
        <li>Execute command "dpkg -i packingtool***.deb" to install web application</li>
        <li>Execute command "packingtool" to launch webapp</li>
        <li>Execute command "dpkg -P packingtool" to uninstall webapp</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Expected Result:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Execute command successfully, directory named "com.example.packingtool" should be created</li>
        <li>Execute command successfully, webapp should be generated in "com.example.packingtool/pkg"</li>
        <li>Webapp should be installed successfully</li>
        <li>Webapp should be launched successfully</li>
        <li>Webapp should be uninstalled successfully</li>
