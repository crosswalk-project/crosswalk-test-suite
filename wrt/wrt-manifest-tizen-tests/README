2. ./resource/ folder is webapp resource file, such as index.html icon.png....

3. ./result/ folder save tesetcase result file.

4. ./metacomm/ folder is allpairs.

5. ./report/ save the auto report wrt-manifest-tizen-tests.xml file.
    5.1 manifest_all_positive.txt is all positive manifest.json content.
    5.2 manifest_all_negative.txt is all negative manifest.json content.

Test Step:
1. unzip wrt-manifest-tizen-tests<version>.zip
2. cd opt/wrt-manifest-tizen-tests/
3. ./inst.sh
4. cd /opt/usr/media/tct/opt/wrt-manifest-tizen-tests/
5. run test.py
   5.1 python test.py
   or 5.2 testkit-lite -f "/opt/usr/media/tct/opt/wrt-manifest-tizen-tests/tests.xml" -A -o ./result.xml --comm localhost

Base on the seed file, the total case number is 397.
