               Can you make it through level four,
               and find all the matching pictures?
               <br><br>
               Start your journey at level one. Finish the level one
               challenge by finding all the pictures three times.
               After you’ve beaten level one, you’ve unlocked level two. 
               Each level gets tougher with more pictures to match.
               <br><br>
               Click a face-down picture card to peek at it. Click another
               to see if you found a match. If not, they’ll flip back over
               and you can try again. If they do match, they’ll remain face up,
               and you’re getting closer to winning!
               <br><br>
               If you want to restart and try a different unlocked level,
               click Home and you’ll go back to the beginning.
