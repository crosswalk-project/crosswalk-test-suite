## Introduction

This test suite is for wrt-packertool-android-tests

## Precondition

1. Download and install allpairs
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/allpairs/files/allpairs/
2. Connect a Android device to your localhost
3. Edit your input_seed.txt(in ./allpairs/) file to generate webapp.
4. Since there are "Shared Mode" test cases during the automation, download Xwalk Runtime Library and put it in crosswalk-test-suite/tools folder
5. Need to edit the file "wrt-packertool-android-tests/arch.txt" according to the type of test device.
If test device is "x86" platform, content of the file should be "x86".

1. allparis is seed file folder:
  1.1 allparis/positive -> positive seed folder,support multi seed files
      allparis/negative -> negative seed folder,support multi seed files
  1.2 seed file format:
     1)Values separator ","
       name--1:a,b
     2)The same field value separter by "--":
       name--1:a,b
       name--2:c,d
     3)Self combination add 'null' to each self field:
       name--2:000,a000b,000b,b000,null
     4)The space character please use 000 to replace:
       000a-> a,a000b->a b,b000->b 
     5)The icon value include ",", so the separator is "comma",please refer to seed file:
       icon--1:{"src": "icon/lowres"comma"sizes": "64x64"comma"type": "image/webp"}

2. ./metacomm/ folder is allpairs.

3. After start test, new folders would be created. And names of the folder are the same
with DEVICE_ID which you input.
   In each new folder, there are several folders like report and allparis.
 ./[DEVICE_ID]/report/ save the auto wrt-packertool-android-tests.xml file.
    3.1 packertool_positive.txt is all positive packertool case content.
    3.2 packertool_negative.txt is all negative packertool case content.
 ./[DEVICE_ID]/allparis/ save test seed file which would be tested on the device.

4. ./ge_manifest.py create packertool resource

5. ./ge_package.py create packertool package

6. ./ge_unitcase.py create tests.py

Test Step:
1. unzip -d [testprefix-path] wrt-packertool-android-tests<version>.zip
2. cd [testprefix-path]/opt/wrt-packertool-android-tests/
3. ./inst.py -i
4. ./ge_package.py
5. run test case
   testkit-lite -f [testprefix-path]/opt/wrt-packertool-android-tests/tests.xml -A -o [testprefix-path]/opt/wrt-packertool-android-tests/result.xml --comm localhost --testenvs "DEVICE_ID=Medfield3C6DFF2E  CONNECT_TYPE=adb;APK_DIR=[apk-folder-path]", DEVICE_ID can also be multiple ids like "Medfield3C6DFF2E,Medfield3C6DFF00".
Query device id by commmand "adb devices -l" in host

Base on the seed file, the total case number is 262.
